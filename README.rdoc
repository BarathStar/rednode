= Node.rb

Node.rb is a pure ruby implementation of the native C++ parts of Node.js. 
Node.rb uses http://github.com/cowboyd/therubyracer - an embedded V8 engine
that runs in the same process as Ruby.

== Why Node.rb?

* You can mix Ruby code and Javascript code in your node app.
* You can launch your (possibly pure js) node app from Ruby, allowing you to use e.g. Cucumber to test it.

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
